# Bag-of-Homebrew
a repository of D&D homebrew content for (almost) all editions!

## Quickstart
Just fork this repository, add your stuff and create a pull request. You can do all this without using git.
Here is a guide to forking and making pull requests to help you out: https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/

## How to contribute 
First, make a folder with your name in a folder of your choice (for example 'spells/wYvernBW'). After you did that make sure your content follows the guidlines below and place your stuff in your folder, and create a pull request. 

## Rules and guidlines
Before uploading your homebrew masterpiece make sure it follows these rules:
1. explicit content must be marked as such (see 'tagging')
2. all homebrew content must be original!
3. homebrew content must be styled with [The Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/).
4. use the a4 page size option in the homebrewery.
5. No self-promotion 
6. content made to shame or insult others is not allowed.

## Tagging
if you want to have tags for your content such as 'in-progress' or 'done', you can create a name.homebrew file (for example if you made a spell called "Ray of Mild Disconfort" you can have a Ray-of-Mild-Disconfort.homebrew file).

example:

``` 
# TITLE : Wandering Madman
# STATUS : in-progress
# WARNING : none
```
